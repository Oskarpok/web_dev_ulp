  Laravel's universal packages are a collection of related modules with 
  clearly defined contracts (interfaces). They enable integration with other 
  backend services (e.g., Go microservices), delegating processing to them and 
  exposing functionality via APIs (REST/GraphQL). This architecture allows for 
  the use of any frontend framework (Vue, React, etc.)—the choice depends on 
  the project's requirements and complexity.
